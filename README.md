# Compatibility Problem

This program addresses the issue of dividing a finite set of individuals into teams to carry out a certain number of tasks. The program displays all the solutions of the compatibility game, which consists of a set $N$ of individuals and a map $c$ from $N$ to $2^N$ such that for all $x \in N$, $x \in c(x)$.
